# Covered California Prescription Search

The purpose of this application is to assist someone when trying to compare different Covered California market plans, specifically from the perspective of prescription drug coverage. Currently each provider makes their drug formulary available on their own website, typically by means of a PDF document with a list of prescriptions and what level of coverage is available as well as any requirements/restrictions that exist. This application will allow a user to search multiple prescription drug names/brand names and search across the different provider's formularies, aggregating the results.
